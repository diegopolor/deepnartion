            To help each person with what takes away their sleep, to find ourselves in a positon where
            there is no communication from the deeper to the heads of the project, the crypto games, the
            creativity and even the future of the project is everything yes, but no forget that deep
            nation is to help each other 
        </p>
        <p>
            We face the challenge of rejection, the real business
            of inserting a new idea, the advantage we have is that this idea is hundreds of years old.
